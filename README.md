# AutoDrive - Autonomous Car Simulation

A Python-based simulation system for autonomous driving cars on a 2D grid field. Cars can move forward, turn left/right, and the simulation detects collisions between vehicles.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (uses match-case statements)
- pytest (for running tests)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoDrive.git
   cd AutoDrive
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Simulation

Navigate to the `src` directory and run the main script:

```bash
cd src
python autodrive.py
```


## Running Tests

```bash
pytest src/tests
```
